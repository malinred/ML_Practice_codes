1) What is MEG?
   MEG (Magnetoencephalography) is a neuroimaging method which is used to track and record the magnetic fields produced by the brain during various activity. Since these magnetic signals are weak in nature,
   We require powerful/sensitive sensors such as SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices). These sensors are stored in a helmet like devices which is then used to record the magnetic fields          produced by the brain.
